        <b>Foxes</b> are small to medium-sized, omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family Canidae.<br/> 
        They have a flattened skull, upright triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned snout, and a long bushy tail (or
        brush).<br/>
        Twelve species belong to the monophyletic "true foxes" group of genus Vulpes.<br/>
        Approximately another 25 current or extinct species are always or sometimes called foxes;
        these foxes are either part of the paraphyletic group
        of the South American foxes, or of the outlying group, which consists of the bat-eared fox, gray fox, and island
        fox.<br/>
        Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica.
