    What is the care of nature? Preservation of clean water in the river is a concern for nature. After all, if the water is contaminated, fish, water animals and insects will start to perish, and the balance in nature will be disturbed. Preservation of this balance is a prerequisite, because everything in nature is interconnected. Accurate disposal of various wastes is a concern for nature. Yes, if a person came to the forest and just threw a plastic bag there, he already caused damage to nature. And if he took it with him and threw it in the garbage, he took care of nature. Putting a bird feeder in winter is also a concern for nature. If every person does something to protect nature, at least something, our environment will be favorable, beautiful.
    
    Everything that surrounds us is nature. Air, earth, water, mountains, forest, sea, lawn, birds, animals in the forest – all this is nature. We often say: “Nature is our home.” Otherwise, our environment. And that we could live, that is, live, and live well, happily, our habitat should be in order: water and air should be clean, trees, animals, and birds – healthy, stones – safe. If we can not enjoy nature, then we can never fully live. And that nature could be enjoyed, it is necessary to take care of it. And everyone should do this.
