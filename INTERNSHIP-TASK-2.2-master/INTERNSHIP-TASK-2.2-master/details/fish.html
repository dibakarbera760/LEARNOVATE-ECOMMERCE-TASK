        <b>Fish</b> are aquatic, craniate, gill-bearing animals that lack limbs with digits.<br/> 
        They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores.<br/>
        Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups.<br/>
        Around 99% of living fish species are ray-finned fish, belonging to the class Actinopterygii, with over 95% belonging to the teleost subgrouping.<br/>
        The earliest organisms that can be classified as fish were soft-bodied chordates that first appeared during the
        Cambrian period.<br/>
