        The domestic <b>dog</b> is a domesticated descendant of the wolf.<br/>
        The dog derived from an ancient, extinct wolf,and the modern grey wolf is the dog's nearest living
        relative.<br/>
        The dog was the first species to be domesticated,by hunterâ€“gatherers over 15,000 years
        ago,before the development of agriculture.<br/>
        Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely
        adapted to human behavior,leading to a large number of domestic individuals and the ability to thrive on
        a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.
