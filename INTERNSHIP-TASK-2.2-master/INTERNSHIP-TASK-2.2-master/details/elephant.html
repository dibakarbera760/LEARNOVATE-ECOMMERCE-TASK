        <b>Elephants</b> are a select group of proboscideans belonging to the family Elephantidae.<br/> 
        They are the largest existing land animals.<br/>
        Three living species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the African
        forest elephant, and the Asian elephant.<br/>
        Elephantidae is the only surviving family of proboscideans; extinct
        members include the mastodons. <br/>
        The family Elephantidae also contains several extinct groups, including the
        mammoths and straight-tusked elephants.<br/>
        African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian
        elephants have smaller ears, and convex or level backs.<br/>
        Distinctive features of all elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, massive legs, and tough but sensitive skin.
