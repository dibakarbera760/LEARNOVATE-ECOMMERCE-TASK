        The <b>lion</b> (Panthera leo) is a large felid of the genus Panthera native mainly to Africa.<br/>
        It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail.<br/>
        It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane.<br/>
        It is a social species, forming groups called prides.<br/>
        A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. Groups of female
        lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator;
        although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically
        does not.
