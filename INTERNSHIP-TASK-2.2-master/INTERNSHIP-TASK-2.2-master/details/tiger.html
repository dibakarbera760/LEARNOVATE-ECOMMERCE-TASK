        The <b>tiger</b> (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera.<br/>
        It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside.<br/>
        It is an apex predator,primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar.<br/>
        It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of
        its offspring.<br/>
        Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, before they become independent and leave
        their mother's home range to establish their own.
